```
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -

```

2.  Add the package repository to the source list so it gets updated when typing apt-get update and install Jenkins.

```
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list

```
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install jenkins

```


3. Unlock Jenkins

copy the password and unlock jenkins.

*CONGRATS! JENKINS IS SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED!!*
